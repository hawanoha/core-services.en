# Frequently asked questions, limitations, and best practices

FAQ and best practices for customer attributes in Analytics and Target.


## Best practices and limitations {#section_7F5189B3DAA84EE6865B91D2026EE05A}

Guidance and limitations when using Customer Attributes. 

| Issue | Description |
|--- |--- |
|Customer Attribute Subscription Limitations|When you upgrade to Analytics Premium, there is a 24-hour delay before additional attributes are available. You may see an Attribute Subscription Max error issued during this delay.|
|Custom Analytics ID (s.visitorID)|Setting a customer ID using  s.visitorID is a method of identifying users in Analytics. However, integrations in which Analytics data is exported or imported using the ID Service will not function when a visitor is identified using  s.visitorID.<br>This includes, but is not limited to, shared audiences, Analytics for Target (A4T), and Customer Attributes.<br>For these integrations, setting a custom Analytics ID is not supported.|
|Character length limitations in Analytics|When creating an Analytics subscription, field lengths for the uploaded files are truncated to 255.|

   <td colname="col1"> <p> <b>(Analytics only) </b>How is this functionality different from what is provided in Analytics premium? </p> </td> 
   <td colname="col2"> <p>In the past, customers interested in combining customer attribute data with Analytics data have relied heavily on the data workbench tool for this functionality. Customer attributes exposes this functionality to a wider audience by providing customer attributes as dimensions and metrics in reports &amp; analytics, ad hoc analysis, and report builder. Analytics Standard customers will have access to customer attributes, but with limited capabilities. The full capability is available to Analytics Premium customers. </p> </td>

     <li id="li_B20AEA397F3B4C86A1140CDA61ABD575">The profile API is a REST API call and customer attributes uses FTP. </li>
